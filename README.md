# graspElems
This python script takes as input designation of minimal, full, or extended basis set and either total or individual atomic symbols. Additionally, one can specify number of cores via "-nc #" and include a header for batch submission files for use in HPC resources. The number of cores for a specific serial submission will group together atomic calculations by number of cores.
